# Rest API's that were made with or without using the [Flask Restful package.](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)    


## Basic APi
* The basic APi was just an example that isnt as fleshed out
* Doesnt use a database

* Basic api doesnt have much in the way of a front end but you can use PostMan to interact with the api endpoints. 


## Full Rest API
* Currently building a basic frontend for the Full Rest api 
* You can still use Postman to contact the api endpoints
* Uses Sqllite3 locally and Postgress on production server
* made using flask restful
