# Flask sites and APis
A mix of sites/Apis I made by myself or by following tutorials since Dec 2017. Some of these are old and Im just getting around to getting them hosted and uploaded.

Each site can be cloned and ran locally. Visit each folder to get the specific installation instructions


## live versions 
Each website that is hosted on Heroku occasionally goes to sleep since Heroku's free tier doesnt keep servers up 24/7. So give it a few seconds the first time you interact with each site. 

The code you see in the repo's is the same code in the Heroku site.

Each site uses a Postgress SQl database.
