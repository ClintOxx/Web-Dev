# Flask sites and APis
A mix of sites/Apis I made over time, either to learn or for personal projects. Some of these are old and might not have the lastest versions uploaded yet.

This page will contain a breif overview of each site, with a link to the demo and the specific folder. 

Each site can be cloned and ran locally.


## Live demos 
Each website that is hosted on Heroku goes to sleep 30 mins since its last interaction. Heroku's free tier doesnt keep servers up 24/7, So give it a few seconds the first time you interact with each site. 


Each site uses a Postgress SQl database.

Description:
The code is not hosted publically on github since its a personal business project. 

The purpose of this project is to increase your (business or personal) outreach on reddit guaranteeing that you will make it to the front page of the subreddit you want to target.
