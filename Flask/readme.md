# Flask sites and APis
A mix of sites/Apis I made by myself or by following tutorials since Dec 2017. Some of these are old and Im just getting around to getting them hosted and uploaded.

## Each site can be cloned and ran locally. Visit each folder to get the specific installation instructions


## live versions 
Each website that is hosted on Heroku occasionally goes to sleep since Heroku's free tier doesnt keep servers up 24/7. So give it a few seconds the first time you interact with each site. 

The code you see in the repo's is the same code in the Heroku site.

Each site uses a Postgress SQl database.
