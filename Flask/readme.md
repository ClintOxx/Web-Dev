# Flask sites and APis
A mix of sites/Apis I made over time, some of these are old and Im just getting around to getting them hosted and uploaded.

This page will contain a breif overview of each site, with a link to the demo and the specific folder. 

Each site can be cloned and ran locally.


## Live demos 
Each website that is hosted on Heroku goes to sleep 30 mins since its last interaction. Heroku's free tier doesnt keep servers up 24/7, So give it a few seconds the first time you interact with each site. 


Each site uses a Postgress SQl database.
