# Web-Dev
Intead of making several different repos to show off what I have learned with fullstack dev, I decided to condense them into one repo.


This repo is split between my projects that use Flask and Django backends. The Django side is severely lacking and the Flask projects will be updated.


I have a couple private projects with code that I can't make public, but ill  link to the sites when i finish this readme soon.


I plan to eventually try my hand at using Typescript to make a project.


# -work in progress- 
-insert links to each project here-

-update each project with docstrings and pytest-

-each project is gonna have an overhaul- 


-info about js framworks used-


Feel free to ask questions if you need help with setting anything up
