# Web-Dev
Central repo with multiple projects to show off what I have learned with fullstack dev.

This repo is split between my projects that use Flask and Django backends. The Django side is old(unfished version) and in need of an updates and the Flask projects are in progress of being updated with Vue and React frontends.

I have a couple private projects with code that I can't make public, but ill  link to the sites when i finish this readme soon.

I plan to eventually try my hand at using Typescript for the frontend of one of these projects.
