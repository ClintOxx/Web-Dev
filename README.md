# Web-Dev
Itead of making several different repos to show off what I have learned with fullstack dev, I decided to place my projects all in one repo.

Some of the projects on here are projects I made following tutorials over the last year, while others are 100% made by me, some are a mix between the two.

This  repo is split between my projects that use Flask and Django backends. 

Pure Javascript frontends and JS frameworks like Vue, React are used in the projects.

I plan to eventually try my hand at using Typescript to make a project.

I have a few private projects with code that is not publically aviable on here for privacy reasons. There are still urls to link to the private projects when possible.

-insert links to each project here-
