# Web-Dev
Intead of making several different repos to show off what I have learned with fullstack dev, I decided to condense them into one repo.

Over the last year I made some of these projects by following tutorials, while others are 100% made by me, the rest are a combination of the two.

This repo is split between my projects that use Flask and Django backends. The Django side is severely lacking and the Flask projects will be updated.


I have a couple private projects with code that I can't make public, but ill try to link to the sites where possible.


I plan to eventually try my hand at using Typescript to make a project.


# -work in progress- 
-insert links to each project here-

-update each project with docstrings and pytest-

-each project is gonna have an overhaul- 


-info about js framworks used-


Feel free to ask questions if you need help with setting anything up
